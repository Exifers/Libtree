=== Tiger Compiler Project ===

== About ==
This project is about programming a compiler in C++ for the Tiger programming
language (https://www.lrde.epita.fr/~tiger/tiger.html), ie outputting assembly
from a source file. Making this project involves parsing, building an abstract
syntax tree, checking the syntax, evaluating the tree, etc. All of that is done
in that program.

== Prerequisites ==
- Linux
- flex, version 1.2.6
- bison
- autotools (> TC-0)

== How to compile this project ? ==
For now just type 'make', and run the tc binary with './tc'.

== How to use Tiger Compiler ? ==
The binary 'tc' reads Tiger source code on standard input.

== Licence ==
You're free to copy, share, reuse this code the way you want.
