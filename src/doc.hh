These pages document the implementation of the EPITA Tiger Compiler
Project (http://tiger.lrde.epita.fr).

This very important project in the EPITA curriculum consists in the
implementation of a Tiger compiler in C++. The Tiger language is
described by Andrew Appel in his "Modern Compiler Implementation"
books.

Most of the material students need to implement their Tiger Project is
to be found in the http://www.lrde.epita.fr/~tiger/ directory.  In
particular, reading http://www.lrde.epita.fr/~tiger/assignments.html
is mandatory.

The reader will find more information in various places listed on
http://tiger.lrde.epita.fr/.
