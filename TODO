             --> fixed by including meta variables

== Questions to Yaka ==

* Since we have a glr do we have to remove all the '%prec' in parsetiger.yy ?
  - There's warning about those during compilation

* Is it a good idea to make lists of Expr, or lists of VarDec as attributes
  of some nodes ?
  - to store stuff like 'id exp {, exp}'
  -> use vector instead (from assignements, only vector and maps are used)
