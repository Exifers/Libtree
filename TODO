== Bug List ==

[|] Lexer : see what ANSI-C means                        | 
[|] Lexer : add double quote escape on STRING type       |> updated to given
[|] Lexer : add \num, \xnum, backslash and double quote  |  code version
[ ] Lexer : add comments
[ ] Lexer : raise error on unknown character

[|] Parser : fix the shift/reduce conflict (1 left) -> one in the reference
[!] Parser : 'let in print("hello") end' raises an error -> the lexer
             keeps reading beyond end of file

[ ] AST : add LBRACE tyfields RBRACE rule 


== Questions to Yaka ==

* Since we have a glr do we have to remove all the '%prec' in parsetiger.yy ?
  - There's warning about those during compilation

* Is it a good idea to make lists of Expr, or lists of VarDec as attributes 
  of some nodes ?
  - to store stuff like 'id exp {, exp}'
  -> use vector instead (from assignements, only vector and maps are used)

* How to stop the lexer to read after EOF token ? -> see bug list
