== Questions to Yaka ==

* How to include the test-suite with autotools ?
  - AC_TESTDIR and EXTRA_DIST have been tested in configure.ac

* Since we have a glr do we have to remove all the '%prec' in parsetiger.yy ?
  - There's warning about those during compilation

* Is it a good idea to make lists of Expr, or lists of VarDec as attributes 
  of some nodes ?
  - to store stuff like 'id exp {, exp}'
